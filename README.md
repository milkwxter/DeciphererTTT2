# Decipherer Role for TTT2
A new role for TTT2.

The Decipherer is a new Detective variant.
His special ability is that he spawns with the WH-B3 Minitester.

The WH-B3 Minitester has the powerful ability to confirm peoples roles, similar to a Traitor Tester found on maps.
However, it has limited ammo and two long (configurable) cooldowns.

The first cooldown is the Results Timer. This cooldown starts at 10 seconds (configurable) and once it is complete, you will learn the role of the player you scanned.
The second cooldown is the Recharging Cooldown. This cooldown starts at 40 seconds (configurable) and once it is complete, you are able to use the Minitester again.
